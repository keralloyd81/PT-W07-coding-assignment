"# PT-W07-coding-assignment" 
Instructions:
In Visual Studio Code, write the code that accomplishes the objectives listed below and ensures that the code compiles and runs as directed.
Comment your code, to prove that you understand what you have written -- this is required!
Create a new repository on GitHub for this week's assignments and push your code to the repository.
Create a Video showcasing your assignment.
Submit the two URL links for the GitHub repo and Video in the Text box.
Coding Steps:
All questions should be printed to your Browser's console using console.log()

Create an array called ages that contains the following values: 3, 9, 23, 64, 2, 8, 28, 93.
Programmatically subtract the value of the first element in the array from the value in the last element of the array.
Do not use numbers to reference the last element, find it programmatically.
ages[7] - ages[0] is not allowed!
Add a new age to your array and repeat the step above to ensure it is dynamic. (works for arrays of different lengths).
Use a loop to iterate through the array and calculate the average age.

Create an array called names that contains the following values: 'Sam', 'Tommy', 'Tim', 'Sally', 'Buck', 'Bob'.
Use a loop to iterate through the array and calculate the average number of letters per name.
Use a loop to iterate through the array again and concatenate all the names together, separated by spaces.

How do you access the last element of any array?

How do you access the first element of any array?

Create a new array called nameLengths. Write a loop to iterate over the previously created names array and add the length of each name to the nameLengths array.
For example:

let names = ["Kelly", "Sam", "Kate"];    // starting with this array
let nameLengths = [5, 3, 4];             // create a new array

Write a loop to iterate over the nameLengths array and calculate the sum of all the elements in the array.

Write a function that takes two parameters, word and n, as arguments and returns the word concatenated to itself n number of times. (i.e. if I pass in 'Hello' and 3, I would expect the function to return 'HelloHelloHello').

Write a function that takes two parameters, firstName and lastName, and returns a full name. The full name should be the first and the last name separated by a space.

Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns true if the sum of all the numbers in the array is greater than 100.

Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns the average of all the elements in the array.

Write a function that takes two arrays of numbers and returns true if the average of the elements in the first array is greater than the average of the elements in the second array.

Write a function called willBuyDrink that takes a boolean isHotOutside, and a number moneyInPocket, and returns true if it is hot outside and if moneyInPocket is greater than 10.50.

Create a function of your own that solves a problem. In comments, write what the function does and why you created it.

Video Steps:
Create a video, up to five minutes max, showing and explaining how your project works with an emphasis on the portions you contributed.
This video should be done using screen share and voice over.
This can easily be done using Zoom, although you don't have to use Zoom, it's just what we recommend.
You can create a new meeting, start screen sharing, and start recording.
This will create a video recording on your computer.
This should then be uploaded to a publicly accessible site, such as YouTube.
Ensure the link you share is PUBLIC or UNLISTED!
If it is not accessible by your grader, your project will be graded based on what they can access.
